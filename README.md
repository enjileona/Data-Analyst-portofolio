## Hello, I'm ENJI! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Physics undergraduate student, mastering the basics of physics and also having a strong interest in data analysis. With my analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, fast learning ability, and high dedication, I spent the last fourth months delving into the field of data analysis.

During this period, I have successfully completed various projects, mastered the use of various data analysis tools, and coordinated various project elements smoothly. Currently, I am looking for new opportunities to develop skills and experience in the field of data analysis. I am ready to face bigger challenges and contribute to the world of data analysis.

## Description:
This repository contains files related to data analyst project. 

## Content:
1. **Ms. Excel Project**:
   <br/>The Excel project utilizes the Coffee Sales dataset, comprising approximately 1000 entries. The process begins with data collection, followed by transforming it into pivot tables and pivot charts to 
   construct an interactive and dynamic coffee sales dashboard.
  
2. **Ms. Excel x Tableau Project**:
   <br/>The British Airways data analysis aims to provide comprehensive insight into passengers' experiences with the airline. We can evaluate various aspects, including flight comfort, crew service, aircraft cleanliness, food and drinks, and onboard entertainment. From the dashboard, users can select the type of review they want to view, adjust the data display to the desired time interval, and filter by seat type and customer category. This allows users to gain a deeper understanding of passenger preferences and experiences, thereby enabling companies to design more effective strategies in improving customer service and satisfaction.

3. **SQL Query**

   <br/>Data Cleaning <br/>
   The project aims to analyze coffee sales at company "X" comprehensively. The focus includes understanding sales patterns based on different types of coffee, such as robusta, arabica, excelsa, and liberica. Additionally, sales in the three largest countries and to the top five customers will be analyzed. The analysis will be adjusted to a specific time range and will also involve classification based on roasting color and packaging weight. Furthermore, the project will examine the impact of loyalty cards on purchasing patterns. Through data visualization, this project aims to provide an understanding of the dynamics of coffee sales at company "X" to support strategic decision-making in marketing, inventory management, and customer service. <br/><br/>Data Exploration<br/> The data exploration process in the provided SQL was conducted to gain a deeper understanding of layoff data. Initially, the entire dataset from layoffs_staging2 was displayed for an initial inspection of its structure and content. Following this, several simple queries were executed, including finding the maximum number of employees laid off in a single event and examining the extreme percentages of layoffs to gauge their impact. Additionally, queries were employed to identify companies with notably high layoff rates, likely indicating failed startups. Further exploration involved more complex queries, such as identifying companies with the highest number of layoffs in a specific year and analyzing layoff trends over time by calculating the total layoffs per month or year. This data exploration process provided a comprehensive understanding of patterns and trends related to layoffs within the dataset, serving as a foundation for further analysis.

5. **Ms.Power BI Project**
   <br/>Visualizations in Microsoft Power BI based on the Data Professional Survey Breakdown offer valuable insights to stakeholders in the data industry. By examining the distribution of respondents by country, average salaries by job title, and programming language preferences, professionals and companies can gain a better understanding of trends and preferences within this industry. This aids in making better decisions regarding recruitment, skill development, and adjusting business strategies to achieve desired objectives. Additionally, information on satisfaction levels regarding work-life balance and salary provides further insights into critical aspects affecting the well-being and productivity of data professionals. Understanding these aspects allows companies to develop strategies to enhance employee satisfaction and retention.
